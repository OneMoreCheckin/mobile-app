## Thanks for installing Cordova!

## Plugins

* Plugins **MUST** add their plugin mapping to their app's Cordova.plist Plugins key, if not they will not work (see your plugin's README)
* Plugins **MUST** add any external hosts they connect to to the white-list in Cordova.plist/ExternalHosts (add hostnames **only**, NO protocols nor paths) - see the [**Domain Whitelist Guide**](http://docs.cordova.io/en/edge/guide_whitelist_index.md.html#Domain%20Whitelist%20Guide)
* A plugin's Objective-C code **MUST** be added to the project properly in a "group" (**YELLOW** folder), if you incorrectly added it as a folder reference it would be a blue folder (just delete the reference, and re-add)
* A lot of plugins have changed their mapping names in **Cordova.plist**, you might have to copy and use the new **Cordova.plist** in your app.
